# Dynamo
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. However, it is not easy to completely implement as a course project. So in this report, we select 3 key features, Consistent Hashing, Anti-entropy, and Gossip-based protocol to build a simplified version of Amazon Dynamo. In order to test the correctness of our Dynamo, we create unit tests to test the features and do a PBS-like test to measure the performance of our Dynamo.
